/**
 * Optional credential source: a running Enigma vault (github.com/DanyPops/enigma),
 * if one happens to be configured on this machine. Purely additive — Tickets
 * has never imported Enigma's package and never will; this talks to Enigma's
 * loopback HTTP API using only @danypops/daemon-kit, which Tickets already
 * depends on for its own daemon plumbing. Enigma's discovery contract is three
 * stable, documented constants (its state-directory name and its handle/token
 * filenames), not an import of Enigma's own source.
 *
 * Never creates Enigma's handle or token files — those are strictly Enigma's
 * own job on its first boot. A consumer that could mint them would be a real
 * security problem, not a convenience. Absence of either file means "Enigma
 * isn't running or isn't configured for this backend," not an error: every
 * failure path here resolves `undefined` rather than throwing, and the whole
 * attempt is time-bounded so a slow or hung Enigma can never stall Tickets'
 * own startup.
